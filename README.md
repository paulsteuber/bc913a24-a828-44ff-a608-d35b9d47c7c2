# Event App | Teclead Ventures

This Event App is "just" a coding challenge. It lists events that it gets from an API. The biggest features are:
* __the search function__, which allows you to filter the events by search query
* __the sorted and grouped events__, the events are allways grouped and sorted by date
* __the shopping cart__, you can add events to the shopping cart and also remove them from shopping cart
